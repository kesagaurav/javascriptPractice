console.log(userName);
var userName="gaurav";
so the above one with var it will not give any errors,but with the let keyword we will give error like is not instantiated navigate_before
why is this ? 
bec of hosting.
what is hosting?
hosting is an spcial fetaure of js which end means the 
js engine it looks for browser,when it loads ur script goves over ur entire
script and it does things like look for functions and automatticaly loads 
and registers so that u can write functions below
the code . 
Invisible incase of var it will pull the reference data and keep it has institaton ex:-var username like this broweser internally do in case of var.But also it is used for let and const as well.
