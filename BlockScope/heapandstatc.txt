the heap is our long term memory.
it stores data in sytsem memory.
stack -> end imp for the data and it is used for short term memory.
the functions them selves has stored in the heap.

function getName(){
    return prompt("ur nmae is");
}

function greet(){
    let name=getName();
    console.log(name);
}

greet();

so when the js file start excurting first it will see the function greet and add it to the stack
afterwadrs it will set getName() function and it will add it to the stack.
and also js will keep tracks of all functions called so which function called what.
and prompt() will be puhsed to stack.
impnote:- whenever when the function returns a value or simply is done with all the steps it will be remobed/pop one by one by the stack.For this js engine will do for us.
